This machine is currently configured in rootless mode. If your containers
require root permissions (e.g. ports < 1024), or if you run into compatibility
issues with non-podman clients, you can switch using the following command:

        podman machine set --rootful

API forwarding listening on: /Users/mrolli/.local/share/containers/podman/machine/qemu/podman.sock

The system helper service is not installed; the default Docker API socket
address can't be used by podman. If you would like to install it, run the following commands:

        sudo /usr/local/Cellar/podman/4.8.2/bin/podman-mac-helper install
        podman machine stop; podman machine start

                You can still connect Docker API clients by setting DOCKER_HOST using the
following command in your terminal session:

        export DOCKER_HOST='unix:///Users/mrolli/.local/share/containers/podman/machine/qemu/podman.sock'

Machine "podman-machine-default" started successfully
